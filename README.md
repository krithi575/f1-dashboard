# 🏁 Formula 1 Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project offers a detailed, interactive exploration of Formula 1 (F1) data, including analysis of circuits, constructors, and legendary drivers over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard is divided into **three primary sections**:

### 1. **Circuit Dashboard**
- 🌍 Map showing global F1 circuit locations.
- 📈 Average number of laps by circuit.
- 🔥 Circuits with the highest crash incidents, broken down by decade.
- 🏁 Top countries by number of races held from 1950s to 2020s.
- 📅 Year-wise distribution of races, showing the sport’s growth.

### 2. **Constructor Dashboard**
- 📉 Trend of constructor participation over the years.
- ⭐ Constructors with best average starting positions.
- 🏆 Top constructors by career points and decades of success.
- 🏁 Count of wins by constructor and their nationalities.
- 📊 Pole count vs. win count for top constructors.
- 🌍 Pie chart of constructor nationalities: British, American, Italian, and others.

### 3. **Top 5 Drivers Comparison**
- 🏎️ Driver-wise total win count.
- 📅 Decade-wise domination by Hamilton, Schumacher, Prost, Senna, and Vettel.
- ⏱️ Fastest lap counts visualized as a treemap.
- 💥 Most crash-prone drivers.
- 🏆 Wins by circuit and driver-constructor combinations.
